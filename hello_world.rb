puts "Hello World!"

# Hi Frances! Can you see me editing this? Yes Awesome.
# See how there is a blue circle on this tab? That means this file is not saved yet.
# So I just added an exclamation mark. I'm going to run this program from the terminal below.
# ok
# did you see how I typed ruby hello_world.rb below and the program this very program
# ran and we printed hello world yes

# Great. Notice though, it printed "Hello World" and this file currently says "Hello World!"
# Thats because we haven't saved our new version. I'm going to go to File -> Save in the top left menu

# I saved the file and the circle becomes an X (on the tab above) i still see a blue circle

# Right because we are constantly changing this file. But Once we saved it, until the next edit, it will be an X
