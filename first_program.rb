puts "this is a program"
puts "program are interpreted at runtime"
puts "which measn even though i am writing this tuesday november 3rd 1359 hrs. the time is now" + Time.now.to_s
puts "programs have flow, like water flow, they run one string after the other"

puts "which means you see this first"
puts "and now you see this second"
puts " and you see this third"

puts "lines of code are executed linearly, thats its flow"
puts "first come, first serve"

puts "programs are composed of three things"
puts "a LANGUAGES KEYWORDS, like 'if' or 'and', approx. 43"
puts "like literal pieces of data, like this sentence / STRING."
puts " finally BAREWORDS and VARIABLES, that are set equal to things"
puts "anything that isnt one of those will cause and error"
puts "like the word 'see' below, i removed it so the progrm rruns to the end"

puts "'see' by itself is not a string, its not a language keyword, its not barewords or variable"
puts "WORDS IN A PROGRAM
Every word and character in a program has to be valid code for the ruby language. Basically, every word can be one of three possible things:
1/A Ruby keyword, something that's part of the ruby language.
2/Literal data, things like 'Strings' and Numbers 1,2.
3/Barewords you define and create, things like variables and methods."
