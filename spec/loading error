If you're program doesn't work at first and you think you're 
doing everything right here are a few things you can try:

1) Close and reopen Nitrous
2) Type ruby your-program.rb in the console - see what it responds with
3) Type "learn" in the console - see what errors you get

More specifically, if you get an error saying your file cannot load..
- close and reopen Nitrous
- click on the 3 dots at the top header next to '(your username)-q-000' 
  and click on "Set Home Folder as Root"
- Next, run your program again making sure 'hello-world.rb' program is under the 'hello-world-spec.rb'
  folder (as opposed to being under the 'specs' folder)
  
That should fix the problem!
